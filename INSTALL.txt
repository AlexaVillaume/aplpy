Installing APLpy
++++++++++++++++

  Prerequisites
  =============

    APLpy requires the following packages to function properly:

      - matplotlib 0.98.5.2 or later
        http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/

      - numpy 1.1.1 or later
        http://numpy.scipy.org/

      - scipy 0.6.0 or later
        http://www.scipy.org/

      - pyfits 1.3 or later
        http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/pyfits

      - pywcs 1.3a1-4.3 or later
        https://www.stsci.edu/trac/ssb/astrolib

    The Enthought Python Distribution (EPD) is an easy-to-install
    package that contains the Matplotlib, Numpy, and Scipy packages.
    If EPD, pyfits, and pywcs are installed, APLpy should work out of
    the box. If not, please contact us through email or the forum
    at sourceforge.net. Note that to satisfy the version requirement
    for matplotlib, you should install v4.2 of EPD. APLpy can still
    be used with older versions of matplotlib, but problems may occur
    in certain situations..
