    - fixed an issue which ocurred when reading in FITS cubes

    - fixed an issue which led to the last tick along an axis being missing
      for coarse images

    SciPy Dependency Dropped
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    While SciPy is a great python package, it can be troublesome to build and
    install from scratch. Thanks to Tom Aldcroft's suggestion and highlighting
    some of his own code we were able to easily drop the SciPy dependency.

    New Features
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - Users can now pass a pyfits HDU instance instead of filenames for both
      FITSFigure() and show_contour() if desired.

    - Users can now specify an existing figure with the figure= argument.

    - Users with a recent enough version of matplotlib (0.98.6svn) can now use
      the subplot= argument to place multiple plots in a single figure.

    - New hide/show_tick_labels() and hide/show_axis_labels() methods.

    - Show_grayscale and show_colorscale() now accept percentile_lower= and
      percentile_higher= as arguments.

    - Show_grayscale and show_colorscale() now print out vmin and vmax if
      chosen automatically.

    - New recenter() method to pan and zoom non-interactively.

    General Fixes and Optimization
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    - Added HDU keyword for the show_contour() method.
    
    - More robust reading in FITS file for the show_contour() method.
    
    - Warning if FITS files do not exist for FITSFigure() or show_contour().
