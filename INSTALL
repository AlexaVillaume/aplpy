**Installation Instructions

*NumPy and Matplotlib

APLpy requires NumPy-1.3.0 or later, and matplotlib-0.99 or later.
There are two different ways to install these packages.

You can download the required packages from the NumPy and matplotlib
home pages, and install these using the standard installation method,
for example:

    tar xvzf NumPy-1.3.0.tar.gz 
    cd NumPy-1.3.0 sudo
    python setup.py install

Be sure to install NumPy before Matplotlib!

The second alternative, if you have easy_install installed, is:

    easy_install NumPy
    easy_install matplotlib 

which will install the latest versions. Bear in mind, that some
computers will require the sudo command before the easy_install
command. If you run into complications installing any of these packages
you should go to the NumPy and/or Matplotlib mailing lists for help.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
*pyfits

In order to read/write FITS files, APLpy requires pyfits-2.1 or later
to be installed. The pyfits module is developed at the Space Telescope
Science Institute, and the link can be found at the top of this page.
Once you have the tar file downloaded, you can either install it using
the standard installation method:

    tar -xvzf pyfits-2.x.x.tar.gz 
    cd pyfits-2.x.x sudo python setup.py
    install

or using easy_install:

    easy_install pyfits-2.x.x.tar.gz


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
*pywcs

In order to use the World Coordinate System (WCS) information contained
in FITS file headers, APLpy requires pywcs. The pywcs module is
developed at the Space Telescope Science Institute, and can be
downloaded pywcs link provided at the top. Once you have the tar file
downloaded, you can either install it using the standard installation
method:

    tar -xvzf pywcs-1.5.x-x.x.x.tar.gz 
    cd pywcs-1.5.x-x.x.x sudo python
    setup.py install

or using easy_install:

easy_install http://stsdas.stsci.edu/astrolib/pywcs-1.5.x-x.x.x.tar.gz


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
*Montage (optional)

Currently, one of the features in APLpy (re-projecting a FITS file to
point north) requires Montage to be installed. Montage is a set of
tools developed at the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center (IPAC)
to re-project and mosaic FITS files. If you do wish to use the north
argument when initializing a FITSFigure instance, you will need to
install Montage. Installation instructions are available on the Montage
website.

**APLpy

*New APLpy Install

If you have easy_install, you can install APLpy by simply typing

    easy_install aplpy

Otherwise, you can install APLpy by downloading the latest available
tar file from 

http://sourceforge.net/projects/aplpy/files/

and using the standard installation method:

    tar -xvzf APLpy-0.9.x.tar.gz
    cd APLpy-0.9.x sudo
    python setup.py install


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
*Updating APLpy

If you have easy_install, you can update APLpy to the latest version by
simply typing

    easy_install -U aplpy

Alternatively, simply follow the instructions given for installation to
install the latest tar file manually.
